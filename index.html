                    My name is Marx Bacungan and I'm currently studying computer science at Stony Brook University. I'm in my 3rd year of undergrauate college. Along with majoring in Computer Science, I'm also pursuing a minor in Digital Arts. I was born in Manila, Philippines and eventually moved to America at the age of 10. My interest in Computer Science was a product of being glued to a computer at a very young age. And once I finally took an intro class about Java and Webdesign in High School, thats when I decided that this is what I want to pursue in the future. When I'm not glued to the computer, I like taking hikes and playingvarious sports, mainly basketball and soccer. I also enjoy playing board games like chess, checkers and Connect 4 and Scrabble.

                    Growing up as a kid, back when the Nokia 8210 was the phone everyone had, I always played this particular called Snake Game. The Snake Game is one of the default, if not the only default game, on those types of nokia phones. Back then it was my favorite and I played it quite a lot. Years past and I finally learn the basics of coding and for my CDT 208 class, Intro to Media Technology, I decided to recreate the game on Processing. Processing is an open source programming language meant for new media art and visual design. I recreated a fully functional version of the snake game from the ground up and added a few twist of mine own. Aside from the regular goal of eating the capturing an objected piece, once one is captured the speed of the snake increases thus making the game harder. I plan on adding different types of levels of the games, including obstacles. I also added music to it by creating a song in audacity. <a  href="https://github.com/marxgb/SnakeGame" link="#ff0000" vlink="#000000" alink="#ff0000">Repo</a>

                    My other passion is graphic design, although I don't do as much once I got to college, I still have a love for creating art.  I still get an occasional request from friends, and former teachers to create  logo designs or posters and flyers for certain events such as concerts, plays and advertisements. I would say my designs are cartoonish in nature but every piece hides a clever idea or message in the design and arrangement upon closer inspection. The 3 posters on the right are some of the posters I've made which are from my  High School Senior play, a flyer for career day and a poster for a comedy night.
